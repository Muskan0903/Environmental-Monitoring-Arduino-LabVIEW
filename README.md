## 📋 Project Overview

This project monitors environmental parameters like **temperature**, **humidity**, and **light intensity** using Arduino Uno with DHT22 and LDR sensors. Data is:
- Visualized locally in **LabVIEW**
- Sent to **Firebase Realtime Database** via **ESP-01S (ESP8266)** for remote IoT monitoring.

It combines **real-time local visualization** and **cloud-based data storage**, making it ideal for industrial, agricultural, or smart home applications.

## 🔌 Circuit Diagram

DHT22 Sensor
VCC → Arduino 5V

DATA → Arduino D2 (Digital Pin 2)

GND → Arduino GND

Note: A 10kΩ pull-up resistor is recommended between DATA and VCC.

🔹 LDR Sensor
One terminal of LDR connected to 5V

Other terminal connected to:

A0 (Analog pin) of Arduino

And a 10kΩ resistor to GND (Voltage Divider Configuration)

🔹 ESP-01S (ESP8266)
Since ESP-01S operates at 3.3V logic, we use AMS1117-3.3V regulator to power it safely.

VCC → Output of AMS1117-3.3V (NOT Arduino 3.3V)

GND → Common GND (shared with Arduino)

CH_PD → 3.3V (via AMS1117 output)

TX → Arduino Pin 10

RX → Arduino Pin 11 (via voltage divider: 1kΩ + 2kΩ) to step down 5V TX to ~3.3V

Use SoftwareSerial on pins 10 (RX) and 11 (TX) for communication

🔹 AMS1117 Regulator Module
IN → Arduino 5V

GND → Common GND

OUT → 3.3V to ESP-01S VCC & CH_PD

## 🧠 Arduino Code (UNO)

Arduino reads DHT22 & LDR, then:
- Sends data via USB serial to LabVIEW
- Sends data to ESP8266 via SoftwareSerial

---

## 📶 ESP8266 Code (ESP-01S)

ESP receives serial data from Arduino, parses it, and uploads:
- Temperature → `/Environment/Temperature`
- Humidity → `/Environment/Humidity`
- Light → `/Environment/Light`

---

## 📊 LabVIEW Front Panel

- **Numeric indicators** for Temp, Humidity, Light
- **Waveform chart** for real-time plotting
- **LED Alert** for threshold warnings
- Data read from **Serial (COM)** at 9600 baud

## 🔥 Firebase Structure

/Environment
├── Temperature: 29.6
├── Humidity: 67.1
└── Light: 381

> Uses Firebase ESP8266 Client Library by Mobizt

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Arduino collects sensor data
2. Sends data to:
   - LabVIEW via USB
   - ESP-01 via SoftwareSerial
3. ESP uploads parsed values to Firebase
4. User monitors data remotely via Firebase or locally in LabVIEW
